Seasons

As a new age comes, so dawns the summer sun.
Often dry and hot, its brutal rays microwave us.
We cool ourselves down while it forbades us from leaving.
What is the true purpose of a beachside visit?

Then winter arriws, brining no snow but all rain.
It brings it typhoons that bring families pain.
Yet when it all settles down, we're left as husks.
Would the next seasons like this be a must?
