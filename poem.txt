Seasons

As a new age comes, so dawns the summer sun.
Often warm and hot, its placid rays shine on us.
We cool ourselves down in its venerable heat.
That is the true purpose of a beachside visit.

Between two great seasons lie an age of respite.
Leaves turn red, and the breeze is but a delight.
Nor hot or cold, it is a true state of affairs.
A season called autumn that tells you to prepare.

Then winter arrives, bringing mystical snow.
Not typhoons or pain, but a blanket of cold.
When it all settles down, we're left chilly inside.
We celebrate Christmas before the next year arrives!

The next year arrives, yet it's not summer...
Rather, the flowers bloom and the air is filled with dew.
Before the rise of summer, there must first be spring.
A hidden season where trees flourish and birds sing.
