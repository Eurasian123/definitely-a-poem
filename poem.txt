Seasons

As a new age comes, so dawns the summer sun.
Often warm and hot, its placid rays shine on us.
We cool ourselves down in its venerable heat.
That is the true purpose of a beachside visit.

Then winter arriws, brining no snow but all rain.
It brings it typhoons that bring families pain.
Yet when it all settles down, we're left as husks.
Would the next seasons like this be a must?
