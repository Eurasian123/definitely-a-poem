Seasons

As a new age comes, so dawns the summer sun.
Often warm and hot, its placid rays shine on us.
We cool ourselves down in its venerable heat.
That is the true purpose of a beachside visit.

Then winter arrives, bringing mystical snow.
Not typhoons or pain, but a blanket of cold.
When it all settles down, we're left chilly inside.
We celebrate Christmas before the next year arrives!
